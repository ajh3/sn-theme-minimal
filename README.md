# sn-theme-minimal

For Standard Notes (https://standardnotes.org/)

This theme is nearly the same as the default/blank theme, but widens the skinny scroll bars and toggles off the editor resizing feature, which frequently gets in the way of the scroll bars.

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04

Installation instructions: https://docs.standardnotes.org/extensions/publishing.html
