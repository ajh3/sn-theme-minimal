# sn-theme-minimal

For Standard Notes (https://standardnotes.org/)

This theme is nearly the same as the default/blank theme, but widens the scroll bars. Helpful for people who want to do that, as well as anyone who wants to toy with customizing a barebones SN theme.

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04

Installation instructions: https://docs.standardnotes.org/extensions/publishing.html
